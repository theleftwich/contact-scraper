Link Scraper
============

What is this?
-------------------
This contact scraper will:
- visit a list of URLs/pages from a Google Spreadsheet
- grab the name of the person in the contact box on that page
- report errors if the page won't load for some reason

How to use this program
----------------------------------
1. Click on contactScraper.zip. This will take you to a page with a big gray box with a "View Raw" link in it. Right-click on on the "View Raw" link and save the link.

2. Navigate to wherever you saved the link. You should see a file called contactScraper.zip. Unzip it, open the folder, and double-click on contactScraper.exe.

3. PLEASE READ THE DIRECTIONS IN THE DIALOG BOX. If you have a lot of links to test, the scraper may take a few minutes to run.

4. You will need to have the URL of a Google spreadsheet of links you want to scrape.
